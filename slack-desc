gl2ps: gl2ps (an OpenGL to PostScript printing library)
gl2ps:
gl2ps:   GL2PS is a C library providing high quality vector output for any
gl2ps: OpenGLapplication.  The main difference between GL2PS and other
gl2ps: similar libraries is the use of sorting algorithms capable of handling
gl2ps: intersecting and stretched polygons, as well as non manifold objects.
gl2ps: GL2PS provides advanced smooth shading and text rendering, culling of
gl2ps: invisible primitives, mixed vector/bitmap output, and much more.
gl2ps:   GL2PS can currently create PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript
gl2ps: (EPS), Portable Document Format (PDF) and Scalable Vector Graphics
gl2ps: (SVG) files, as well as LATEX files for the text fragments.  GL2PS also
gl2ps: provides limited, experimental support for Portable LaTeX Graphics
gl2ps: (PGF). You can also use the excellent pstoedit program to transform
gl2ps: the PostScript files generated by GL2PS into many other vector formats
gl2ps: such as xfig, cgm, wmf, etc.
